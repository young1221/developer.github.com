# Event Types

Each event has a similar JSON schema, but a unique `payload` object that is
determined by its event type.  [Repository hook](/v3/repos/hooks/) names relate to event types, and will have the exact same payload.  The only exception to this is the `push` hook, which has a larger, more detailed payload.

This describes just the payload of an event.  A full event will also
show the user that performed the event (actor), the repository, and the
organization (if applicable).

Note that some of these events may not be rendered in timelines.
They're only created for various internal and repository hooks.
