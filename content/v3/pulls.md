# Pull Requests

* TOC
{:toc}

The Pull Request API allows you to list, view, edit, create, and even merge
pull requests. Comments on pull requests can be managed via the [Issue
Comments API](/v3/issues/comments/).

Pull Requests use [these custom media types](#custom-media-types). You
can read more about the use of media types in the API
[here](/v3/media/).

## Link Relations

Pull Requests have these possible link relations:

Name | Description
-----|-----------|
`self`| The API location of this Pull Request.
`html`| The HTML location of this Pull Request.
`issue`| The API location of this Pull Request's [Issue](/v3/issues/).
`comments`| The API location of this Pull Request's [Issue comments](/v3/issues/comments/).
`review_comments`| The API location of this Pull Request's [Review comments](/v3/pulls/comments/).
`review_comment`| The [URL template](/v3/#hypermedia) to construct the API location for a [Review comment](/v3/pulls/comments/) in this Pull Request's repository.
`commits`|The API location of this Pull Request's [commits](#list-commits-on-a-pull-request).
`statuses`| The API location of this Pull Request's [commit statuses](/v3/repos/statuses/), which are the statuses of its `head` branch.

## List pull requests

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`state`|`string` | Either `open`, `closed`, or `all` to filter by state. Default: `open`
`head`|`string` | Filter pulls by head user and branch name in the format of `user:ref-name`. Example: `github:new-script-format`.
`base`|`string` | Filter pulls by base branch name. Example: `gh-pages`.
`sort`|`string`|  What to sort results by. Can be either `created`, `updated`, `popularity` (comment count) or `long-running` (age, filtering by pulls updated in the last month). Default: `created`
`direction`|`string`| The direction of the sort. Can be either `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`


### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:pull) { |h| [h] } %>

## Get a single pull request

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :full_pull %>

### Mergability

Each time the pull request receives new commits, GitHub creates a merge commit
to _test_ whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base
branch. (This _test_ commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch.)
The `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit;
however, this attribute is [deprecated](/v3/versions/#v3-deprecations) and is scheduled for
removal in the next version of the API. The Boolean `mergeable` attribute will
remain to indicate whether the pull request can be automatically merged.

### Alternative Response Formats

Pass the appropriate [media type](/v3/media/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.

## Create a pull request

    POST /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls

### Input

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|-------------
`title`|`string` | **Required**. The title of the pull request.
`head`|`string` | **Required**. The name of the branch where your changes are implemented. For cross-repository pull requests in the same network, namespace `head` with a user like this: `username:branch`.
`base`|`string` | **Required**. The name of the branch you want your changes pulled into. This should be an existing branch on the current repository. You cannot submit a pull request to one repository that requests a merge to a base of another repository.
`body`|`string` | The contents of the pull request.


#### Example

<%= json \
  :title     => "Amazing new feature",
  :body      => "Please pull this in!",
  :head      => "octocat:new-feature",
  :base      => "master"
%>

### Alternative Input

You can also create a Pull Request from an existing Issue by passing an
Issue number instead of `title` and `body`.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`issue`|`number` | **Required**. The issue number in this repository to turn into a Pull Request.

#### Example

<%= json \
  :issue => "5",
  :head  => "octocat:new-feature",
  :base  => "master"
%>

### Response

<%= headers 201, :Location => "https://api.github.com/user/repo/pulls/1" %>
<%= json :pull %>

## Update a pull request

    PATCH /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number

### Input

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`title`|`string` | The title of the pull request.
`body`|`string` | The contents of the pull request.
`state`|`string` | State of this Pull Request. Either `open` or `closed`.

#### Example

<%= json \
  :title     => "new title",
  :body      => "updated body",
  :state     => "open"
%>

Note: The response includes a maximum of 250 commits. If you are working with a pull request larger than that, you can use the [Commit List API](/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository) to enumerate all commits in the pull request.

%>

### Response if merge cannot be performed
